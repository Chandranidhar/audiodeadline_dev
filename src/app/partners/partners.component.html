          Alfa Blvck
        </h2>
        <div class="kb_partnership_block5_inner">
          <p>Every ​once​ and awhile, you come across an artist that immediately captivates your attention. Alfa Blvck​ (Rahim Blocker) age 29, was born and raised in Harlem. In New York, Alfa is at the forefront of the underground rap scene. His unique name comes from his ​love for comic superheroes.​ His uncanny ability to ​black out​ on every track gave rise to a name that symbolized that resolve. What separates Alfa from the rest is his almost endless well of creativity when it comes to releasing content. He has ​mastered​ the art of making his voice sound ​exactly​ how he wants, and therefore ​engineers and masters all of his songs.​ He also did the video editing for his recent music video release "FYTB." Not only is he a ​creative genius,​ he is also a ​master wordsmith.​ Songs like "The Gauntlet" easily injects him into the ranks of rap superstars like ​<span>Kendrick Lamar</span> and <span>J. Cole</span>.​ Alfa Blvck is an independent artist armed with all the required tools to slam the rap game on its head and solidify New York as its top contender.“I measure a man by the extent of his sacrifices...”​ the response when asked how does he decide who to work with or not. ​Packing crowds​ at Highline Ballroom and hosting ​epic release parties​ was a dream to Alfa. He graduated high school and went to Penn State, completing two years before deciding to drop out and ​host his own events at the university.​ Returning home was the beginning of the ​struggle​ when he made the decision to pursue his music career full time. He dealt with on and off ​homelessness​ and wasn’t able to maintain a ​steady love life. His commitment to his dreams lead him down a hard path, and you can hear the results of doing things his way every time he ​speaks​ or ​releases music.
